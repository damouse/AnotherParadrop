"""
The host configuration controls system settings of the host OS.

This module operates as follows:

1. The first time, we try to detect all devices and auto-generate
a reasonable configuration, which we store to a persistent file.

2. (TODO) We present the configuration to the owner sometime around
provisioning or first chute creation and allow him to change settings.

3. (TODO) We have some kind of update operation that can manipulate
settings.
