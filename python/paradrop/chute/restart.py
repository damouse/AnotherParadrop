    This function is called to restart any chutes that were running prior to the system being restarted.
    It waits for pdconfd to come up and report whether or not it failed to bring up any of the interfaces
    that existed before the power cycle. If pdconfd indicates something failed we then force a stop update
    in order to bring down all interfaces associated with that chute and mark it with a warning. 
    If the stop fails we mark the chute with a warning manually and change its state to stopped and save to 
    storage this isn't great as it could mean our system still has interfaces up associated with that chute.
    If pdconfd doesn't report failure we attempt to start the chute and if this fails we trust the abort process
    to restore the system to a consistent state and we manually mark the chute as stopped and add a warning to it.
